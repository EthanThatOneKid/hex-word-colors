# `hex-word-colors` Experiment ðŸ§ª

## To Reproduce

Just clone this repository and spin up this [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) project with `npm i`. To run generate the list, run `npm start`. By default, a preview of each code's color representation is in the report. To generate a list without these previews, run `npm run start:no-color-preview`.

I got the large text file with all the English words from a repository called [`english-words`](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) and downloaded [this file](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt).

## The Results

By running, `npm start`, a report gets generated. A sample report can be found [here](../reports).
