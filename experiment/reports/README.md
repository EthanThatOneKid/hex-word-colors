# Reports

This is the reports directory.
This is the directory that the experiment's scripts dump all their reports into.
At first glance, you can see a bunch of files that have names corresponding to the following template:

```
reportFileName = `${timestampAtCreation}.report.${color}.md`
```

While you are here, click on a report and check it out for reference-sake.

Come back to this directory to see the reports that you generate!
