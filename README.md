# Hex-Word-Colors

> A dictionary of words that can be written as hexadecimal numerals.

## Experiment ðŸ§ª

I was curious if it was possible to write any words as a hexidecimal numeral that would be relavent to their actual color representation. For example, `___`.

### Constraints

There are only so many letters that we have at our disposal to spell words.
Any digit (0-9) is a valid value, however.
Here are the available characters that valid hexadecimal numerals allow:

- Letters: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`
- Numbers: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`

Since there are only 6 (hence _hex_ in "hexadecimal") letters available in hexcodes.
Here is how letters are mapped to numbers if necessary:

| Letter | Number |
| ------ | ------ |
| `g`    | `9`    |
| `i`    | `1`    |
| `l`    | `1`    |
| `o`    | `0`    |
| `s`    | `5`    |
| `t`    | `7`    |
| `z`    | `2`    |
|        |        |

Additionally, valid hexadecimal numerals can be notated with only either a length of 3 or 6. This means that words with only either 3 or 6 letters will be valid.

To test my luck, I decided to see which of these valid words that can be written as a hexadecimal numeral actually represents something that resembles the color of the hexidecimal value.
